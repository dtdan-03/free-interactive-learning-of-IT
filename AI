Sometimes it is helpful to get some inspiration from the so called "intelligent software": Artificial Intelligence (AI).

But before you go on, you should know that these tools do not always tell you the truth!
Otherwise, it helped also me personally already a lot, because it can build you often already a fundament for
your next function, where you can continue your work on.

Be aware: the data here could be soon already deprecated again, because nowadays the tech industry is changing fast.

This file contains some AI plattforms, where you may can get some assist of:

blackbox.ai (no login required)
Blackbox is an AI, that I explored on social media. It is an alternative for OpenAI's chatgpt

chatgpt.com (fka chat.openai.com) (login no more necessary)
ChatGPT is the most popular one of the AI plattforms. May you already heard about it.

https://chat.mistral.ai/ (login required) (from EU! (France))
Mistral is a free alternative to ChatGPT. It is not connected to the world wide web.
Pro point: it is located in the EU (France)! That means, it should be way more data friendly than the big player
due to Europes privacy law GDPR (General Data Protection Regulation)
